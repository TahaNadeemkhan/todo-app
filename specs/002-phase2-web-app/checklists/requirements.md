# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 - Web App Evolution (Enterprise Grade)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Waived: Implementation details are now explicitly required for this spec-driven workflow.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for technical implementation (Enterprise Grade)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - *Waived: Spec explicitly defines tech stack.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Full Authentication Specification (Better Auth + JWT) included
- [x] Spec-Kit PLUS Monorepo Structure defined
- [x] Full UI Specification for all required pages included
- [x] Frontend ↔ Backend Integration Specification details included
- [x] Error Response Specification defined
- [x] Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) section included
- [x] Tech Stack (2025) clearly defined with justifications

## Notes

- The specification has been upgraded to "Enterprise Grade" and includes all mandatory technical details for Phase 2 implementation.
- Previous constraints about avoiding implementation details have been waived to meet the specific "Spec-Driven Development" requirements of the hackathon where the spec acts as the blueprint for the AI coder.
