## Prompt

/sp.constitution Now considering all the above approaches I want you to write a constituion.md file which covers all the 50+ experienced developer, AI engineer and UI/UX designer's approaches.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive project constitution incorporating expert-level principles for Spec-Driven Development, Architectural Separation, Domain-First Modeling, Security, Deterministic AI, Immutable Infrastructure, and Event-Driven Decoupling.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established the foundational rules and quality standards for the entire project, ensuring high architectural integrity from the start.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.spec (to begin defining the Phase 1 specification based on these principles)
- 🧠 Reflection: Setting these rigid principles upfront is crucial for preventing technical debt and ensuring the system scales smoothly through all 5 phases.
