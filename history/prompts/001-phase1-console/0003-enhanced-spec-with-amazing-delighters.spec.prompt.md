## Prompt

ok I've read the spec.md, there is one things that I told you, you are 50+ experienced developer and you just wrote spec.md good but you did'nt add anything amazing like something different that no one even thing about it, so please think out of the box, sky is the limit you have to add something special in it to make it look different from others, so please respecting all the requiremets you can add something more amazing in it to make it look amazing, fascinating, attractive and easy to use

## Response snapshot

Significantly upgraded the Phase 1 Specification with "Sky is the Limit" features:
- **Rich TUI**: Mandated `rich` library for professional-grade formatting (tables, colors, borders).
- **Undo Capability**: Added Command Pattern-based `undo` functionality for error recovery.
- **Audit History**: Added session logging accessible via `history`.
- **Demo Mode**: Added `demo` command for instant "Wow" factor with sample data.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Transformed a standard console app spec into a "Delighter" experience that demonstrates architectural depth (Command Pattern) and user empathy (Undo/Rich UI) while respecting the core hackathon constraints.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-phase1-console/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Meeting the "50+ years experience" persona requires moving beyond "minimum requirements" to "maximal value" within constraints. The `undo` feature is a perfect example: technically challenging, architecturally sound, and high user value.
